Rhythm Doctor is a one-button rhythm game that aims to invisibly teach complex music and rhythm theory.

The core mechanic is simple: slam your spacebar on the 7th beat to save patients in a hospital. But every level has a twist on that concept: polyrhythms, offbeats, hemiolas, irregular time signatures.. if those don’t mean much to you, don’t worry - it’s designed to make you learn rhythm theory without even realising it.

The simple one-button control scheme is balanced with brutally hard precision down to milliseconds, making saving every patient a challenge.

	<history>
Two friends learnt game development solely driven by this game idea, while studying Engineering and Actuarial Science at university. They then won an IGF nomination for the game back in 2014, while they were still in school. The response was overwhelming, with the online demo game being played more than 400,000 times. Now that they've finally graduated, they've expanded their team and are going full steam on development to finish this game. As of 29th March 2017, their game has been Greenlighted on Steam and will be released later this year.

			<description>The base mechanic and premise of Rhythm Doctor are gold for me. Rhythm is in everything, and I'm glad the developers found it in medicine.</description>
