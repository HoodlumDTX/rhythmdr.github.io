Instructions to build

0. change the “data.xml” files in Notepad or an xml editor. Do NOT change the html directly!
	The html will get auto-generated when the rest of the steps are carried out.

0. Note that there are two presskits, one for 7th beat games, one for Rhythm Doctor.
After you modify the xml…

1. open terminal or cmd

2. go to this RDPresskit folder
 (cd C:/Users/somethingsomething/rhythmdr.io/RDPresskit)

3. type:
 	presskit build -o ../

^ remember the ../ or it wont work!

You should see a long many lines of processing in the console. 

4. Check out the newly generated index.html on a web browser.

5. If that looks good, use Github to sync it to the online version. And then when you load rhythmdr.com and click presskit, it should be all new
